          <h2>Software engeneer</h2>
          <p>My interest in computer science began in 2021, when I wrote my first line of code in Java during the corona pandemic.
         I was fascinated by the power and creativity of programming, and I decided to pursue it as a career.
          I took many courses online and offline, and built many projects using various technologies and languages.
           I even helped other computer science students with their projects and exams, demonstrating my skills and knowledge.
            One of my proudest achievements was creating my own new sorting algorithm, which was faster and more efficient than the existing ones.
             I also passed the FCS exam, which is a prerequisite for admission to computer science programs in many universities.
              I am passionate about computer science and eager to learn more and advance in this field.
